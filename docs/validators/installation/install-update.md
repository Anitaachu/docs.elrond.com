title: Installing a Validator Node
---

## **Install your node(s)**

After preparing the user permissions, the script configurations, and the keys, the actual node installation can begin. The Validator script is a multi-purpose tool for managing your node, it is accessible to Devnet and Testnet Network.

- *Note: This process installs a validator node for all Elrond networks (mainnet, devnet, and testnet).*

Following these few steps, we will work on installing the Elrond Network validator node to get it up and running on your local machine.

 For installation use`1 - install`

```bash
 ~/elrond-go-scripts-mainnet/script.sh
 1) install
 2) observing_squad
 3) upgrade
 4) upgrade_proxy
 5) upgrade_squad
 6) remove_db
 7) start
 8) stop
 9) cleanup
 10) github_pull
 11) get_logs
 12) quit
 Please select an action:1
```

- When asked, indicate the number of nodes you want to run, i.e. `1`
- When asked, indicate the name of your validator, i.e. `Valar`
- Quit the menu without starting (we need keys first) by using `12 - quit`

### **Prepare your keys**

Create a new folder "VALIDATOR_KEYS" to serve as a local backup when updating:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir -p ~/VALIDATOR_KEYS
    
```

Generate a certificate file containing your Validator key by running the `keygenerator` :

 ```bash
./elrond-utils/keygenerator
    
```

Copy the generated `validatorKey.pem` file to the `config` folder of your node(s), and repeat for each node.

```bash
    cp validatorKey.pem ~/elrond-nodes/node-0/config/
    
```

:::tip
Each node needs its unique `validatorKey.pem` file
:::

Then copy the `validatorKey.pem` file - in ZIP form - to the `$HOME/VALIDATOR_KEYS/` folder . This is important for your node to be able to restart correctly after an upgrade.

```bash
zip node-0.zip validatorKey.pem
mv node-0.zip $HOME/VALIDATOR_KEYS/
    
```

Repeat the above process for all your “n” nodes. When complete, please refer to our Key management section for instructions about how to properly backup and protect your keys.

### **Start the node(s)**

```bash
~/elrond-go-scripts/script.sh start
```

### **Start the node visual interface**

Once the node has started, you can check its progress, using the `TermUI` interface. Navigate to your `$HOME/elrond-utils` folder and start the `TermUI`, one for each of your nodes:

```bash
cd $HOME/elrond-utils
./termui -address localhost:8080
```

:::tip

 Your first node is called `node-0` and it is a REST API that will run on port `8080` by default. The next node is `node-1`on port `8081`, and so on.
:::

## **Update your node(s)**

Upgrade your node by running the script and selecting either of these options:

- `10 - github_pull` downloads the latest version of the scripts
- `3 - upgrade`
- `7 - start`
- `12 - quit`

```bash
~/elrond-go-scripts/script.sh
```

These are the basic steps. Please carefully read the on-screen instructions, refer to the scripts [readme file](https://github.com/ElrondNetwork/elrond-go-scripts-mainnet/blob/master/README.md). You can also ask any questions in the Elrond [Validators chat](https://t.me/ElrondValidators)

## **Mandatory: Backup your keys**

Your private keys are needed to run your node. Losing them means losing control of your node. A 3rd party gaining access to them could result in loss of funds.

Find them in `$HOME/elrond-nodes/node-0/config` [be mindful of your “`n`” nodes]

:::important

Create a safe backup for them on storage outside of the server running your node(s).
