# Whatâ€™s new?

Hello Validators!

The current version of the scripts works to increase the validator experience. This validator script is a general script that can be used by all Elrond Networks: Mainnet, Devnet, and Testnet. With the added option of incrementing the number of nodes on the server.
Another new addition to the scripts is the performance evaluation tools which can be used to benchmark your host (local machine) and ensure that it is performing properly.

Following a few steps, we will work on installing and managing the Elrond Network validator node to get it up and running on your local machine using the validator scripts.
