Popularly referred to as the "future of money," Maiar currently has a robust web wallet extension known as the¬†**Maiar DeFi Wallet Extension**. It is a powerful browser extension for the Elrond Wallet that effectively automates and reduces the steps and time required for users to interact with Elrond Decentralized apps.

The Maiar DeFi Wallet can be installed on Chrome, Brave, and other chromium-based browsers. This extension is free and secure, with compelling features that allow you to create a new wallet or import existing wallets, manage multiple wallets on the Elrond mainnet, and store Elrond tokens such as EGLD, ESDT, or NFTs on the Elrond Network with easy accessibility.

Let's walk through the steps how to install and set up the Maiar DeFi Wallet extension:

### Create a new wallet

**Step 1:** To get started, first install the [Maiar DeFi wallet extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/maiar-defi-wallet/dngmlblcodfobpdpecaadgfbcggfjfnm).

**Step 2:** Open up the extension and click on _‚Äò‚ÄôCreate new wallet‚Äù_.

**Step 3:** Next, a secret phrase consisting of a set of 24 secret words will be displayed. Safely backup these secret words. We strongly recommend you write them down or copy and store them in a safe place like a password manager.  These secret words are the key to your wallet account and cannot be recovered if lost.

### Import existing wallet

Do you already have a wallet?

Then there is no need to create a new one. The Maiar Wallet Extension provides an option to import your existing wallet. However, to import an existing wallet you must have access to its¬†**secret (recovery) phrase**.

The Maiar wallet has a set of 24-words, which serve as your wallet‚Äôs secret phrase. Using a secret phrase to import an existing wallet does not affect your wallet in any way.

**To get started:** 

**Step 1:** With the [Maiar DeFi wallet extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/maiar-defi-wallet/dngmlblcodfobpdpecaadgfbcggfjfnm) installed. Click on ‚Äò‚ÄôImport existing wallet‚Äù.

  ![maiar-defi-example-welcome-page](/wallet/wallet-extension/wallet_extension_step4.png)
 
**Step 2:** Next, enter your 24-word secret phrase. You can either enter these words one at a time or you can simply paste in the words using the "_paste_" icon.

   ![maiar-defi-example-import-wallet](/wallet/wallet-extension/wallet_extension_step14.png)
  
**Step 3:** Enter in your wallet password and confirm this password. 

  ![maiar-defi-example-password](/wallet/wallet-extension/wallet_extension_step13.png)
  
**Step 4:**  Completed! Your Maiar DeFi Wallet has been successfully imported and set to be used.
